# Changes

All changes can be disabled in the mod settings. (Main Menu > Settings > Mod Settings)

- **New Bacteria Recipes:** Bacteria can now be directly converted into iron and copper plates. Combine bacteria with bioflux to produce steel and green circuits.

- **Biochamber Rework:** Biochambers have been made more useful by allowing them to craft many existing recipes, and they can now be used on space platforms to produce thruster fuel with nutrients made from carbon and suflur.

- **Wood and Fish Farming Rework:** Fish breeding now consumes tree seeds instead of nutrients, which allows breeding fish to produce nutrients to power your biochambers and biolabs on Nauvis.

- **Enemy Balance:** Strafer and stomper spawn rates are reduced when you first arrive on gleba, and slowly return to normal by the time medium pentapods begin spawning. An optional setting allows you to permanently reduce strafer and stomper spawn rates.

- **Hungry Biolabs:** Biolabs now consume nutrients instead of electricity, giving an additional use for nutrients produced by tree and fish farms. (Like all of these changes, this can be disabled in the mod settings)

# Optional Settings

These are disabled by default but can be enabled in the mod settings. (Main Menu > Settings > Mod Settings)

- **Change or Disable Spoilage for Individual Items:** Choose separate spoilage times for nutrients, bacteria, and agricultural science packs, or make them never spoil.

- **Always Fresh Agricultural Science:** When enabled, newly crafted agricultural science is always 100% fresh, even if the ingredients were partially spoiled.

- **More Seeds from Fruit:** Increases the rate at which seeds are produced by processing fruit, to speed up the process of establishing your first farms on Gleba.
